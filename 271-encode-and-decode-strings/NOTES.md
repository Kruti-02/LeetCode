**For encoder :**
#create an empty string res, trverse through each character in strs and add it to result with prefix of its length followed by#
​
**For Decoder :**
​
#result will be stored in a list and we will have a pointer i that will tell us the position in the string.
#While i is still in bound we will decode the string character by character
#initaite the j pointer and increment it by 1 until the # is found
#This is the length of our character starting from i up until j, wich is not included and convert it into an integer.
#This gives us how long we have to  read the string
#incrementing the i pointer
