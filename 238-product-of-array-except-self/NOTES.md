#Create a result output array Innitially with 1 and multiply it by lem nums
#Calculate the prefix by innitializing it by 1
#Go to every position in our input array
#for each number in res i take it and put it in prefix
#Multiply the nums i by the prefix value
#Innitiate the postfix array
#Iterate through the inputs from behind  until the begining
#multiply the result i with the postfix values
